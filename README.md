### Drinks

13 Bottles of Wine - mix of Red & White. Lighter, more acidic is better to balance out the heavy meal than a heavy, tannic wine like a Cab. Avoid wines higher than 14.5% alcohol, 12-13.5% is ideal. Six packs of dry cider or beer (pilsner, dark porter, pale ale, stout) is also good if you don't want to bring wine.

Some suggestions:

- Loire Valley
- cru Beaujolais
- California red field-blends
- Oregon pinot noir and pinot gris
- dry Lumbruscos
- Muscadet
- Chablis
- reds and whites from Mt.Etna in Sicily
- Spanish reds from Ribeira Sacra
- Finger Lakes rieslings
- syrahs from norther Rhone and California
- Whatever the wine shop tells you is a good buy
